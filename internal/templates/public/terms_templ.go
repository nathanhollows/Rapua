# Terms and Conditions 

## The short version:

- Rapua is in active development. I'm constantly adding features and improving things. I'll do my best to ensure backwards compatibility as features change.
- By using Rapua, you're helping advance research in game-based learning. Your *anonymised gameplay data* may be used for research. Your personal info stays private.
- Credits are non-refundable, and if you delete your account, any unused credits will be deleted too. It's a thorough and non-reversable process.
- Credit prices might increase as Rapua grows. Price changes won't affect any credits you've already purchased.
- Play fair. Accounts that abuse the system or violate these terms may be suspended.

---

## Acceptance of terms (The long version )

By accessing and using Rapua, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the service.

### Service Description

Rapua is a location-based game platform that allows users to create and run interactive experiences.

**Active Development**: Rapua is under active development by a sole developer. New features will be added and existing features may change. I will do my best to migrate data to ensure continuity, but cannot guarantee perfect compatibility during major updates.

The service is provided on an "as-is" basis without warranties of any kind.

### Research and Data Usage

**By signing up and using Rapua, you agree to have your anonymised game and account data used for research purposes.**
This research may include:

- Academic research and publications in the field of game-based learning.
- PhD studies and postgraduate research projects.
- Analysis of gameplay patterns, user engagement, and educational outcomes.
- Conference presentations and academic papers.

**Data Protection**:

- All data used for research is **anonymised** - your personal information will not be identifiable in any publications or presentations.
- No identifying information (names, emails, institutions) will be included in research outputs.
- Data collected for research purposes is handled separately from your personal information (see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>).
- Research will be conducted in accordance with ethical research practices.

By using this service, you acknowledge that anonymised data collected during your use may be included in academic research and publications.

### Pricing and Payment Terms

Rapua operates on a credit-based system. See the <a href="/pricing">Pricing page</a> for current rates and details.
**Important pricing terms**:

- One credit = one team starts playing.
- All features are available to all users - no premium tiers or locked functionality.
- Credits are deducted when the first player from a team enters their team code.


### Payment Processing

All payments are processed securely through **Stripe**. We do not store any payment card information. By making a purchase, you agree to Stripe's terms of service.
<h4 id="no-refunds">No Refunds</h4>
All credit purchases are **final and non-refundable**. Please ensure you understand the pricing model before purchasing.
**Exception**: Refunds may be issued at my sole discretion in cases of technical errors or exceptional circumstances.

### Price changes

I reserve the right to change prices at any time without warning. Any price changes will:

- **Not affect existing credit balances** - your purchased credits remain valid at the price you paid.
- Be reflected on the <a href="/pricing">Pricing page</a>.

### Account deletion

**Important**: When you delete your account, you **forfeit all purchased credits**.

- Account deletion is **immediate and permanent**.
- All data is deleted, including games, teams, and gameplay data (except data stored by Stripe for compliance).
- **No refunds** are provided for unused credits upon account deletion.
- Please ensure you have used all purchased credits before deleting your account.

### Service availability

I strive to maintain high availability, but do not guarantee uninterrupted access to the service. As a solo developer, I may:

- Perform maintenance that temporarily affects availability.
- Add, modify, or discontinue features as development continues.
- Experience outages beyond my control.

No credits will be refunded for service interruptions or feature changes.

### Acceptable use

You agree not to:

- Use the service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the service.
- Interfere with or disrupt the service or servers.
- Use the service to transmit harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content.
- Abuse the credit system or attempt to exploit bugs for free credits.

### Account termination

I reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you:

- Violate these Terms and Conditions.
- Use the service inappropriately or abusively.
- Engage in fraudulent activity.

Terminated accounts forfeit all credits with no refund.
<h4 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h4>
Rapua is licensed under the **MIT License**. The platform code is open source, but:

- The Rapua name and branding remain my property.

- I do not claim ownership of your games, locations, or creative content.

### Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- Rapua is provided "as-is" without warranties of any kind.
- I am not liable for any damages arising from your use of the service.
- I am not responsible for lost data, missed opportunities, or gameplay issues.
- My total liability is limited to the amount you have paid for credits in the past 12 months.

### Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Rapua and its operator from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the service or violation of these terms.
