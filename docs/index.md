# Introduction

**[Kia ora!](https://www.google.com/search?q=kia+ora)** Welcome to Rapua, a platform designed to make it easy to create games for education in the real world. Whether you’re an educator, trainer, or organiser, Rapua provides the tools to design immersive, place-based learning experiences that engage participants and teach complex concepts.

Rapua is the culmination of years of research and development in the field of educational games. I have worked with a variety of organisations to create custom games for their specific needs, and I have seen firsthand the power of games to engage learners and make learning fun.

## What does Rapua mean?

*Rapua* is the te reo Māori word for "search" or "explore." The name was given to the platform by the Law faculty at the University of Otago, for whom the first version of this platform was developed. The name reflects the platform’s focus on exploration and discovery, as well as its roots in New Zealand.

## Why Rapua?

Games are a very effective way to engage and educate, and Rapua was designed with this in mind. With Rapua, you can:  

- **Simplify Complex Ideas**: Teach challenging concepts in an engaging and approachable way.  
- **Reach Diverse Audiences**: Tailor experiences for participants of all ages and abilities.  
- **Foster Real-World Learning**: Create games that blend education with real-world exploration.

And because I believe impactful learning should be accessible to everyone, **Rapua is free for all educators and communicators forever.**
