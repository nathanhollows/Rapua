# Introduction

**[Kia ora!](https://www.google.com/search?q=kia+ora)** Welcome to Rapua, a platform designed to make it easy to create games for education in the real world. Whether youâ€™re an educator, trainer, or organiser, Rapua provides the tools to design immersive, place-based learning experiences that engage participants and teach complex concepts.

Rapua is the culmination of years of research and development in the field of educational games. I have worked with a variety of organisations to create custom games for their specific needs, and I have seen first-hand the power of games to engage learners and make learning fun.

## Read the Docs

Rapua is a hosted platform and open-source project. There are two sets of documentation available:

- [**User Docs**](/docs/user/) for those who want to create and manage games using Rapua.
- [**Developer Docs**](/docs/developer/) for those who want to install and host their own version of Rapua or contribute to the project.
