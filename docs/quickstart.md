# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Rapua! Follow these five simple steps to set up and launch your first game. Whether youâ€™re hosting a team-building event, an educational exercise, or a community activity, Rapua makes the process quick and straightforward.

## Step 1: Create an Instance

Every game begins with an instance. An instance is the container for your game, where you define the rules, locations, and teams.

1. [Log in](/login) to your Rapua account.  
2. Navigate to your [Instances](/admin/instances) and click **Create New Instance**.  
3. Give your instance a name (e.g., "Orientation" or "Health and Safety Tour").  
4. Save the instance to proceed.  

Youâ€™re now ready to add locations, content, teams, and update the settings!

**Tip:** Your current instance will be displayed on the dashboard for easy access. The fastest way to switch between instances is to click on the instance name.

## Step 2: Add Locations  

Define the physical locations where players will interact. Rapua expects all locations to be real-world spots, such as landmarks, buildings, or objects.

1. Go to the [Locations](/admin/locations) tab.  
2. Click [Add Location](/admin/locations) and provide the following details:  
   - Location name (e.g., "Library").  
   - Points (hidden by default, see [Step 4](#step-4-update-game-settings) for details).
3. Use the map to pinpoint the location or enter the coordinates manually. Use the search bar for quick location lookup by address.
   - **Tip**: Zoom in for precise placement.
3. Save your location and repeat for all necessary spots.  

**Tip:** Add at least three locations for variety and better engagement. This makes a good starting point for most games, and will help visualise the gameplay more in [Step 4](#step-4-update-game-settings).

---

## Step 3: Add Teams  

Organize participants into teams for collaboration or competition.  
1. Navigate to the [Teams](/admin/teams) tab in your instance.  
2. Click **Add Team** and specify the number of teams you want to create.
3. Save your team and repeat as needed.  

**Tip:** Teams can be added at any point, but itâ€™s easier to plan ahead.

## Step 4: Update Game Settings  

Customize the gameplay experience.  

1. Open the [Experience](/admin/experience) tab under your instance.  
2. Adjust the following options:  
   - **Navigation Method:** How will participants know where to go? Choose from map, list, or clues.
   - **Navigation Mode:** How will participants move between locations? Select free movement, random selection, or guided paths.
   - **Enable Points:**: Enable or disable scoring mechanisms (optional).  
3. Save your changes.

**Tip:** Hover over the information icons ðŸ›ˆ for additional guidance. Each setting influences the gameplay, so choose wisely.

## Step 5: Start (or Schedule) the Game

Your game is ready to launch!  
1. Go to the [Activity](/admin/actvity) page.  
2. Choose one of the following:  
   - **Start**: Launch the game immediately.  
   - **Schedule**: Pick a date and time for automatic launch.  
3. Share team codes with participants to join the game.

Thatâ€™s it! Your game is live, and participants are ready to explore and learn.
