# Features

Rapua is a platform for creating location-based educational games. It is designed to be easy to use, scalable, and impactful. Here are some of the key features that make Rapua a powerful tool for educators and communicators.

## 1. Web-Based and Lightweight

Rapua is entirely browser-based, ensuring a hassle-free experience for both creators and participants.

- No app downloads or installations required.  
- Accessible from any modern web browser.  
- Lightweight design means it runs smoothly on most devices.

This makes it easy to get started and ensures that your games are accessible to a wide audience.

## 2. Flexible and Easy Game Design

Rapua makes it easy to design games that suit your content, audience, and space. Whether you have a few participants or hundreds, for a small space or a city-wide adventure, an hour or a month, Rapua has you covered.

- **Content Types**: Add text, images, videos, checklists, and more to your game.
- **Navigation Modes**: Use maps, names, or clues to guide participants.
- **Movement Styles**: Choose between free movement, random selection, or guided paths.  
- **Competitive or Collaborative**: Design games that encourage competition or teamwork.

Rapua was specifically designed to overcome the challenges of scaling educational games and avoiding congestion. By providing a range of options, Rapua gives you the flexibility to create games that meet your specific needs and learning objectives.

## 3. Share locations between games

Rapua allows you to share locations between games, making it easy to create a series of games that build on each other.

For example, you could create a series of games that explore different aspects of a city, with each game focusing on a different theme or learning objective. Players all start at the same location, but then branch out to explore different parts of the city based on the game they are playing. This allows you to easily piggyback off the work you have already done, saving you time and effort.

## 4. Helpful Guidance and Automation

Creating a game shouldn’t require hours of setup. Rapua simplifies the process with:  

- Automatically generated game rules based on your settings.  
- Easy-to-understand participant instructions to save you time.  
- Built-in guidance to help you make pedagogically informed decisions.  

## 5. Scalability and Real-World Testing

Designed by a science communicator with real-world needs in mind, Rapua can handle:  

- Large-scale events like university orientations or corporate training sessions.  
- Small, intimate learning experiences for schools or community groups.
