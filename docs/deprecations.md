# Deprecations

You're seeing this page because documentation you were looking for has been removed or relocated.

## What Happened?

The Rapua documentation is continuously evolving alongside the platform's development. During this process:

- Some pages are moved to more logical locations
- Outdated content is removed
- Documentation structure is reorganized for better usability

When documentation is moved, you'll be automatically redirected to the most relevant current page. If a page has been completely removed, you'll land here instead.

## Finding What You Need

To locate the information you're looking for:

- Browse the [User Documentation](/docs/user/index) for end-user guides
- Check the [Developer Documentation](/docs/developer/index) for implementation details

## Reporting Missing Documentation

If you believe documentation is missing by mistake, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/nathanhollows/rapua/issues) or contact support. We'll address it promptly.
