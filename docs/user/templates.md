# Templates

Templates are blueprints that you can use to launch new games quickly. They are pre-configured snapshots of games that can be shared and reused.

## What are Templates?

Templates contain all the settings, locations, and content of a game, but do not include any teams or historical play data. They're designed for:

- Creating historical snapshots of games (without play data)
- Sharing game configurations with other facilitators
- Quickly launching new instances of a game
- Standardising event setups

By default, templates use the same location codes as the original game, allowing multiple instances to overlap with the same QR codes, posters, and check-ins. This is particularly useful for events with multiple sessions, for example, a museum with different groups of different ages.

## Creating Templates

All templates are managed in the [Games and Templates](/admin/instances) section of the admin interface. You can create a template from any game you have access to, including games you have created or those shared with you.

You can create a template from any existing game:

1. Navigate to the [Games and Templates](/admin/instances) section
2. Choose the game you want to use as a template
4. Click "Create template" (this may be collapsed under the ellipsis menu)
5. Enter a name for your template

Once created, templates cannot be edited, but you can always create a new template from an updated game.

## Launching Games from Templates

To launch a new game instance from a template:

1. Navigate to the Templates section
2. Find the template you want to use
3. Click the "Launch" button
4. Choose a name for the new game instance
5. Click "Launch"

The system will create a new game with all the settings, locations, and content from the template. You'll then be able to add teams and manage the game like any other.

## Sharing Templates

You can share templates with other users, allowing them to launch new games based on your template. To share a template:

1. Find the template in your Templates list
2. Click the "Share" button (this may be collapsed under the ellipsis menu)
3. Configure sharing settings:
   - **Time Limits**: Hour, day, week, month, or unlimited
   - **Usage Limits**: Set maximum number of launches or unlimited

Share links will allow **anyone** with the link to preview the template. Only logged-in users can launch templates into new games. 

Games launched from templates will not be visible to the original template creator.

## Template Limitations

Templates have some limitations by design:

- Templates cannot be edited after creation
    - Descriptions and names can be changed, but not the content
- Historical play data is not included
    - This means no team scores, locations visited, or player data
- Deleting a template does not affect games already launched from it

## Best Practices

- Create templates of well-tested games before sharing them
- Use descriptive names and add detailed descriptions
- Set appropriate time and usage limits for sensitive content
- Test launched templates to ensure everything works as expected
