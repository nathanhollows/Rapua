# Phases of Game Setup

The following is a general guide to setting up a game in Rapua. Your game will have unique requirements, so feel free to deviate from these steps as needed.

## 1. Planning

Outline the logistics of the game:

- **Purpose & Audience** – Define the game’s objectives and target participants.
- **Choose Locations** – Define where the game will take place.
- **Movement & Flow** – Determine how players will [navigate the space](/docs/user/quickstart#step-4-update-game-settings).
- **Supervised or Unsupervised?** – Decide if locations need facilitators or additional activities.
- **Staffing** – Plan required personnel for support and oversight.
- **Resources & Budget** – Allocate necessary materials and funding.

## 2. Build

Set up the game within Rapua:

- **Add Locations** – Input all locations into Rapua.
- **Create Content** – Define clues (if using), tasks, and interactions for each location.
- **Configure Settings** – Adjust movement and interaction settings to shape the experience.

## 3. Trial run

Conduct a trial run to identify issues and improve flow:

- **Prepare Materials** – Print posters, place them in the intended locations or set up temporary ones.
- **Generate Team Codes** – [Create team codes](/docs/user/players-and-teams#creating-teams) for access.
- **Start the Game** – Log in via [`/play`](/play) or [the homepage](/), then navigate locations, scan QR codes, and complete activities.
- **Simulate Real Play** – Carry out the game from a player’s perspective.
- **Measure Time** – Track how long each stage takes.
- **Make Changes** – Adjust content, interactions, and locations as needed.
- **Reset or Delete Team Data** – [Clear test team data](/docs/user/players-and-teams#deleting-and-resetting-teams) to prepare for the live game.

## 4. Iteration

Refine the game by addressing gaps and optimizing the experience:

- **Player Instructions** – Rapua generates rules based on your settings, but you might find additional instructions help.
- **Supporting Materials** – Slides, printed team codes, or other handouts?
- **Team Formation** – How are teams created and assigned codes?
- **Pre-Game Communication** – What information do players need before starting?
- **Technical Requirements** – Are external apps, Wi-Fi, or additional tools needed?

## 5. Play

Once testing is complete:

- **Start the Game** – [Distribute team codes](/docs/user/players-and-teams#distributing-team-codes) and launch the session.
- **Monitor and Support** – Observe and document player experiences.
- **Collect Feedback** – Use participant insights to refine future iterations.

Following these steps will ensure a smooth setup and a successful game experience. Remember, each game is unique, so adapt these steps to suit your specific needs.
