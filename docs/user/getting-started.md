# Getting Started with Rapua

## **Introduction**

### Kia ora!

Welcome to **Rapua**, a platform designed to make it easy to create games for education in the real world. Whether you’re an educator, trainer, or organizer, Rapua provides the tools to design immersive, place-based learning experiences that engage participants and teach complex concepts.

Rapua brings together the best of two platforms:
- **The Amazing Trace**: Developed as part of my Master of Science Communication thesis at the University of Otago, this project explored resource-efficient games for spatially-located learning. It laid the foundation for Rapua’s core features.
- **Te Rapua Hamu**: Created for the Faculty of Law at the University of Otago, this platform supported their vision of gamified learning for specific educational goals.

You can learn more about these projects and my journey on my personal website: [Nathan Hollows](https://nathanhollows.com).

### **Why Rapua?**

I believe games are a powerful tool for learning. They can:
- Teach complex concepts in an engaging and interactive way.
- Connect with diverse audiences.
- Provide immersive, real-world educational experiences.

Rapua is free for all educators and communicators forever. It’s my way of supporting innovation in education and making impactful learning accessible to everyone.

### **How You Can Support Rapua**
If you’d like to contribute to Rapua’s mission, you have several options:
1. **Financial Contributions**: Make a one-time "Pay What You Can" contribution to help support ongoing development and maintenance.
2. **Code Contributions**: Collaborate on the project via GitHub by submitting bug fixes, features, or enhancements.
3. **Share Your Story**: Email me to share how you’re using Rapua in your educational endeavors. Your stories inspire me and guide future improvements.

## Why use Rapua?

Rapua is designed to solve a very specific problem: how to create engaging, educational games that take place in the real world. A problem I often faced was that existing tools were either too complex, too limited, or too expensive. I wanted to create a tool that was easy to use, flexible, and affordable. 

- **Built in crowd control**: Whether you have just a few or hundreds of participants, I've done the hard work of figuring out how to manage large groups of people in a real-world setting, so you don't have to.
- **Flexible**: Schedule games to run for an hour or a month, with a few participants or hundreds. Rapua can handle it all.
- **Web-based**: Rapua is entirely browser-based, ensuring a hassle-free experience for both creators and participants. No app downloads or installations required.
- **Open-source**: Rapua is open-source, meaning you can host it yourself or contribute to the project.
- **Free for educators and communicators**: The hosted version of Rapua is free to use for educators purposes. This offer extends to teachers, librarians, museum educators, science communicators, and anyone else who uses games for educational purposes.
