# Facilitator Dashboard

## Overview

The Facilitator Dashboard is a real-time monitoring tool designed to help game facilitators. The dashboard enables facilitators to efficiently track event flow by monitoring station activity in real-time. A game admin may generate a unique passwordless link for facilitators to access the dashboard.

The Facilitator Dashboard is intended for event staff managing stations to:

- **Track team movement** and anticipate arrivals.
- **Monitor station occupancy** and how long teams stay at a location.
- **Identify completed locations** to determine when a station is no longer needed.
- **Pack up stations early** once all teams have visited.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Facilitators can access the dashboard using a unique passwordless link, which is time-sensitive. Admins generate these links in the [Activity Tracker](/admin/activity) section in the dashboard. The link is then shared with facilitators via email, chat apps, or any communication method.

## Dashboard Features

**Team Activity Overview**

- Displays the total number of currently logged-in teams.
- Shows the total number of locations in the event.

**Location List**
- Provides a detailed list of all locations involved in the event.

**Location Details**

- **Location Name** – The name of the specific location.
- **Teams Visited** – The number of teams that have visited the location out of the total teams.
- **Teams Currently Checked-In** – The count of teams presently at the location.
- **Completion Status** – Indicates if a location is complete, meaning all teams have visited and checked out.

## Data Refresh Rate

- The dashboard updates every **30 seconds** to ensure facilitators have the latest information.

## Security and Limitations
- The dashboard **explicitly does not allow facilitators to provide in-game support** to teams. Since the links are passwordless, allowing such interactions would introduce security risks.
- Links to the dashboard expire after a pre-set duration to maintain security. Facilitators must request a new link from the admin if they need to access the dashboard again.
- The data updates in real-time to reflect the latest team activities.

## Summary

The Facilitator Dashboard is a powerful tool that helps event staff manage stations efficiently. With real-time updates and detailed insights into team activity, facilitators can ensure smooth event execution without needing to intervene directly in the game. For security reasons, access is temporary and must be renewed as needed.
