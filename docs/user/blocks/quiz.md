# Quiz Block

The quiz block allows you to create interactive questions with multiple choice answers. This block supports both single-answer and multiple-answer questions, with options for scoring, retries, and randomisation.

## Features

- Single or multiple choice question types
- Proportional scoring for multiple choice questions
- Retry mechanism allows participants to try again
- Randomisable order shuffles answer options for each player
- Markdown support for rich text formatting in questions and answers

## Scoring System

Single choice questions award full points for the correct answer, while multiple choice questions use proportional scoring based on the number of correct options selected.
