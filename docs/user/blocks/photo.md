# Photo Block

The photo block allows participants to upload photos. Players can take/upload up to a maximum of 5 (as defined by the admin). Use this block to have participants document their surroundings, complete challenges, or provide visual proof of task completion.

## Configuration

- **Prompt**: Instructions for what photos participants should submit
- **Max Images**: Configure how many photos are required (1-5 images)
  - The block is marked complete only when all required photos are submitted
- **Points**: Award points when participants submit the required number of photos

## Notes

- Photos can be deleted and replaced before completing the block
- Once the required number of photos is reached, the block is marked complete and points are awarded
- If points are enabled, participants receive points only after submitting all required photos
