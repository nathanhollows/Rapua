# Image Block

An image block is a simple way to add images to a location page. This block is not interactive and does not award points.

You could use the image block with a URL as a fancy button.

## Notes

There is currently no support for image carousels or galleries, so you'll need to add multiple image blocks if you want to display more than one image. If you would like to see this feature added, please let me know by [requesting a feature](https://github.com/nathanhollows/Rapua/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md).

Image Blocks don't currently allow uploads, so you'll need to host your images elsewhere and link to them. This is a known issue and will be addressed in a future update. For more information, see https://github.com/nathanhollows/Rapua/issues/21
