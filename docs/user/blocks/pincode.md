# Pincode Block

The pincode block allows you to require participants to enter a numeric code to continue. This block _must_ be answered correctly to proceed. If points are enabled, participants are awarded points when they enter the correct code.

## Notes

- The pincode is numeric only and can be any length.
    - For alphanumeric codes, consider using a [Password Block](/docs/user/blocks/password) instead.
- Future development will include the ability to set a maximum number of attempts before the block is marked as incorrect. To see progress on or to show support for this feature, check out the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nathanhollows/Rapua/issues/37)
