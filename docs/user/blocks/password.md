# Password Block

The password block allows you to require participants to enter an alphanumeric code to continue. This block _must_ be answered correctly to proceed. If points are enabled, participants are awarded points when they enter the correct code.

## Notes

- The password can be any length and contain any characters.
    - For numeric codes, consider using a [Pincode Block](/docs/user/blocks/pincode) instead.
- Future development will include the ability to set a maximum number of attempts before the block is marked as incorrect. To see progress on or to show support for this feature, check out the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nathanhollows/Rapua/issues/37)
