# Content blocks

Rapua has twelve content blocks that you can use to create interactive learning experiences.

![Iterative blocks are marked with an `Interative` badge.](/static/images/docs/user/blocks/block-picker.webp)

## Information blocks

These blocks are the foundation of your game and are used to provide information, instructions, and context to participants. They are not interactive and do not award points.

- [Alert Block](/docs/user/blocks/alert)
- [Divider Block](/docs/user/blocks/divider)
- [Image Block](/docs/user/blocks/image)
- [Text Block](/docs/user/blocks/text)
- [YouTube Block](/docs/user/blocks/youtube)

## Interactive blocks

These blocks allow you to create interactive elements in your game that require participants to complete a task or answer a question. They can be used to test knowledge, provide feedback, or guide participants through the game.

- [Broker Block](/docs/user/blocks/broker)
- [Checklist Block](/docs/user/blocks/checklist)
- [Clue Block](/docs/user/blocks/clue)
- [Password Block](/docs/user/blocks/password)
- [Pincode Block](/docs/user/blocks/pincode)
- [Quiz Block](/docs/user/blocks/quiz)

## Planned blocks 

Many more content blocks are [planned](/docs/developer/roadmap#new-content-blocks) for the future, but these are the ones available now. If you have a suggestion for a new block, please [let us know](/docs/developer/contributing).
