# Content blocks

Rapua has a content block system that allows you to add different types of content to your game, whether static information, interactive challenges, or clues for participants to solve.

Some blocks are for clues only (e.g. Random Clue Block), while others can be used anywhere.

## Static blocks

These blocks are the foundation of your game and are used to provide information, instructions, and context to participants. They are not interactive and do not award points.

- [Alert Block](/docs/user/blocks/alert)
- [Button Block](/docs/user/blocks/button)
- [Divider Block](/docs/user/blocks/divider)
- [Image Block](/docs/user/blocks/image)
- [Text Block](/docs/user/blocks/text)
- [Random Clue Block](/docs/user/blocks/random-clue)
- [YouTube Block](/docs/user/blocks/youtube)

## Interactive blocks

These blocks allow you to create interactive elements in your game that require participants to complete a task or answer a question. They can be used to test knowledge, provide feedback, or guide participants through the game.

- [Broker Block](/docs/user/blocks/broker)
- [Checklist Block](/docs/user/blocks/checklist)
- [Clue Block](/docs/user/blocks/clue)
- [Password Block](/docs/user/blocks/password)
- [Pincode Block](/docs/user/blocks/pincode)
- [Quiz Block](/docs/user/blocks/quiz)
- [Sorting Block](/docs/user/blocks/sorting)

## Planned blocks 

Many more content blocks are [planned](/docs/developer/roadmap#new-content-blocks) for the future, but these are the ones available now. If you have a suggestion for a new block, please [let us know](/docs/developer/contributing).
