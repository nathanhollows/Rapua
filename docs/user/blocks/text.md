# Text Block

The text block is a simple way to add text to a location page. You can use it to provide context, instructions, or information. Unlike other blocks, this block is *not* interactive and does not award points. It is a static block that displays text and images.

All content is formatted using Markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. The system will automatically convert your Markdown into HTML for display. Check out the [Markdown Guide](/docs/user/markdown-guide) for more information.

## Example

**Text Block:**

![](/static/images/docs/user/blocks/block-text.webp)

**Player Perspective:**

![](/static/images/docs/user/blocks/block-text-preview.webp)

## Notes

While Markdown supports images with the `![alt text](image-url)` syntax, using the [Image Block](/docs/user/blocks/image) makes it easier to organise content. The same applies to [Checklist Blocks](/docs/user/blocks/checklist) and [YouTube Blocks](/docs/user/blocks/youtube).
