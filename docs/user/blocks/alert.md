# Alert Block

The alert block is a simple way to display important information to participants. It is a static block that displays text and images. Unlike other blocks, this block is *not* interactive and does not award points.

Alerts come in five styles: `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, and `default`. Each style has a different colour and icon to help participants quickly identify the type of alert.

All content is formatted using Markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. The system will automatically convert your Markdown into HTML for display. Check out the [Markdown Guide](/docs/user/markdown-guide) for more information.
