# Getting Started with Teams

Individual and team play with the same way in Rapua. Players can either play solo or share a single device to play as a team. Here's how it works:

- **Individual Play**: Each player uses their own device and a unique team code to play independently.
- **Team Play**: A group shares one device and uses a single team code. Progress is tracked collectively for the team.

**Key Differences**:

| Feature               | Individual Play     | Team Play              |
|:----------------------|:--------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Progress Tracking** | Personal            | Shared                |
| **Device Required**   | One per player      | One per team          |
| **Collaboration**     | Solo                | Team-based            |

## Getting Teams Started

1. **Share the Team Code**:
   - Use the steps below to copy and distribute the team code.
2. **Player Registration**:
   - Instruct players to visit `rapua.nz` and enter their team code.
   - Registered teams appear active on the teams page and will show up in the [Activity](/admin/activity) view.
4. **Begin Play**:
   - Players will automatically be directed to the lobby to set their team name and start the game.
   - The lobby is also where players will wait for the game to start if it's scheduled.


## Creating Teams

1. Navigate to the [Teams](/admin/teams) section in your dashboard.
2. Click `Add Teams` to batch create multiple teams at once.
    - You can specify the number of teams to create and assign a team name prefix.
    - Teams are automatically assigned unique codes for players to join.
3. Click `Create` to add the teams. They will appear in the list where you can manage them further.

Rapua generates random team codes. Team names are blank by default and players will have the option to set their own team names when they start playing and enter the lobby.

## Copying Team Codes

1. Navigate to the [Teams](/admin/teams) section in your dashboard.
3. Click `Copy Codes` to copy the team codes to your clipboard.
    - You can limit codes to specific teams by selecting them before copying.

## Distributing Team Codes

Once you've copied the team codes, you can distribute them to your players by:
* Email, chat apps, or any communication method your players use.
* Display team codes and player names on a shared screen or projector.
* Create "quickstart cards" with team codes and instructions for players to join.
